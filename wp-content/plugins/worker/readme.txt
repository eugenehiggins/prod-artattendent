Make sure you use the latest version of the Worker plugin on the site you are trying to add. If you still have problems, check our dedicated [FAQ page](http://managewp.com/user-guide/faq/my-sites-fail-to-addload-to-managewp "Add site FAQ") or [contact us](http://managewp.com/contact "ManageWP Contact").

= How does ManageWP compare to backup plugins like BackupBuddy, Backwpup, UpdraftPlus, WP-DB-Backup ? =

There is a limit to what a PHP based backup can do, that's why we've built a completely different backup - cloud based, incremental, it keeps working long after others have failed.

= How does ManageWP compare with clone plugins like Duplicator, WP Migrate DB, All-in-One WP Migration, XCloner ? =

These solutions are simple A-B cloning solutions that tend to break in critical moments. ManageWP does it more intelligently. We first upload the backup archive to a cloud infrastructure that we control, and then we transfer it to the destination website. This effectively compartmentalizes the process into two separate steps, making the whole cloning experience much more robust and stress free.
